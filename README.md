# Anarres sec

Ansible role for basic GNU/Linux server hardening.

* Sets up `iptables` for IPv4. **IPv6** will be disabled.
  * Will disable all incoming traffic by default except for established
  connectios, ICMP type 8 pings, the ssh_port and the **loopback** network
  traffic.
* Sets up `fail2ban` with alerts through XMPP.
  * With the SSHd jail.
* Hardens SSH.
  * Disables root login, password loginâ€¦

It requires `iptables` to be flushed if already installed. This can be
achieved with:

```bash
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -F
iptables -X
```

It is part of [anarres](https://github.com/anarres-org/anarres), a playbook that
uses a collection of roles to deploy a full-featured server. But it can be used
and tested independently.

## Compatibility

These are the tested GNU/Linux distributions. Maybe it works on some other
distributions too or just requieres a few changes.

* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
  * buster
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
  * latest

## Requirements

* A configured `sendxmpp_config` file so `fail2ban` is able to send the alerts.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Role Variables

### SSHd

* `ssh_port`: Port for `sshd` to bind to.

### sendxmpp

* `admin_xmpp`: Jabber account of an administrator. Will receive `fail2ban`
notifications.
* `sendxmpp_config`: `sendxmpp` configuration file path.

### fail2ban

* `fail2ban_trusted`: `fail2ban` trusted IPs, hosts or ranges.
* `fail2ban_xmpp_notify`: address used by `fail2ban` to send notifications to.
By default is the same as `admin_xmpp`.

## Dependencies

`sudo` and `python` in the target host(s).

## Example playbook

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    admin_xmpp: admin@host.com
  roles:
    - anarres_sec
```

## Testing

To test the role you need [molecule](http://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
**vagrant**, **virtualbox** and some python requirements that can be installed wwith
`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

```bash
molecule test
```

or

```bash
make test
```

There is more documentation about the installation and configuration of the
required tools at
[Testing - Anarres documentation](https://anarres-org.github.io/anarres/testing/).
